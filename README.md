This repository is mainly for me to share small personal projects in languages ​​and with technologies that I am studying.

Just kidding.

I made this Pong clone in HTML5 and JavaScript just to start studying these languages.

Hope you like it.

The comments are in Portuguese, soon I will make them available in English, in case you want to know what I did.
